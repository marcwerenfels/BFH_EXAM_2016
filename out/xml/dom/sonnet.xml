  <lines>
    <line>My mistress' eyes are nothing like the sun,</line> 
    <line>Coral is far more red than her lips red.</line> 
    <line>If snow be white, why then her breasts are dun,</line> 
    <line>If hairs be wires, black wires grow on her head.</line> 
    <line>I have seen roses damasked, red and white,</line> 
    <line>But no such roses see I in her cheeks.</line> 
    <line>And in some perfumes is there more delight</line> 
    <line>Than in the breath that from my mistress reeks.</line> 
    <line>I love to hear her speak, yet well I know</line> 
    <line>That music hath a far more pleasing sound.</line> 
    <line>I grant I never saw a goddess go,</line> 
    <line>My mistress when she walks, treads on the ground.</line> 
    <line>And yet, by Heaven, I think my love as rare</line> 
    <line>As any she belied with false compare.</line>
